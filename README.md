# WA_chat_export
This is a simple python program by me and my friend gladwin ( He currently has no github account so I can give the link ).
We got irritated by all the unwanted messages in whatsapp groups. we can't able to find the correct message that we want
thats why we created this project. This will ask you for the name of the person who sent this message and fetches all the
messages sent by him

To create the input.txt file open you phone
 > whatsapp > group( of interest ) > menu ( three vertical dots ) > more > export chat

Instructions:
=============
    The WA_chat_export folder contains four files 
      1. input.txt
      2. output.txt
      3. output.csv
      4. main.py
    here the input.txt is the whatsapp chat export and 
    both the output files are sorted form of the messages
Info:
=====
    the delimiter used for the csv file is backtick(`)
